![Pipilika Billboards](/static/pipilika/pipilika-billboards.svg#centered)


Pipilika Search Engine, a pioneering creation in Bangladesh and the Bengali language, was shrouded in immense hype and anticipation before its official unveiling in 2013. Its remarkable success garnered widespread media coverage, substantial funding, and a prominent brand name. 

However, beneath this facade of triumph lies a hidden and sinister history that has been shielded from the public eye. The true inventors behind Pipilika, 'Burhan' and 'Chisty,' were wrongfully pushed into anonymity by the deceitful academic malpractitioner, Dr. Ruhul Amin Shajib, who shamelessly claimed credit for their groundbreaking creation. He single-handedly hijacked Pipilika, robbing its original creators of their rightful recognition and deceiving everyone with false claims for nearly a decade. Shockingly, despite possessing concrete evidence, this distressing story remained undisclosed.

The decision to keep this matter hidden for nearly a decade was made to safeguard the reputation of the university and its department. Regrettably, this secrecy may have contributed to the ongoing predicament surrounding Pipilika. It has become apparent that 'Ruhul Amin Shajib's' deceitful actions are not limited to the Pipilika scandal alone, as more similar tales of mischief have surfaced, echoing the same disturbing pattern. Despite filing a written complaint with evidence to the SUST CSE department, no resolution was found in almost two years, revealing a lack of goodwill from the concerned parties.

Recently, further revelations about 'Ruhul Amin Shajib's' misdeeds have come to the inventors' attention. Having endured years of deprivation and frustration, they fully understand the devastating impact such incidents can have on an individual's well-being and future prospects. As a result, on June 18, 2023, Pipilika's dark history of intellectual property theft was courageously exposed through a series of posts on Facebook. In this website, we have compiled the episodes and evidence published on Facebook, shedding light on the truth behind this distressing saga. 

As our journey of truth and justice continues, we are fueled by the hope that our experiences will spark a positive transformation in academia. We strive to foster a culture of transparency, integrity, and fairness for all. Let our story stand as a beacon of awareness and empowerment, illuminating the path toward a brighter and more just future. Together, we can ensure that intellectual creativity and ingenuity are celebrated and protected, free from the shadows of deceit and exploitation.
