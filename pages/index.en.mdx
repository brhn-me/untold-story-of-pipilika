Pipilika Search Engine, the first of its kind in Bangladesh and Bengali language, generated immense hype before its official unveiling in 2013. It received widespread media coverage, massive funding, and earned significant name recognition and branding. However, behind this facade of success lies a dark history kept concealed from the public eye. The true inventors, 'Burhan' and 'Chisty,' have been pushed into anonymity by a deceitful academic malpractitioner, Dr. Ruhul Amin Shajib, who shamelessly claimed credit for their genius creation. He single-handedly hijacked Pipilika, not only robbing its original creators but also deceiving everyone with false information for nearly a decade. Shockingly, this distressing story remained undisclosed, despite the inventors possessing concrete evidence.

To safeguard the university's and the department's reputation, the matter was kept hidden for nearly a decade. Unfortunately, this secrecy may have contributed to the ongoing predicament surrounding Pipilika. It appears that 'Ruhul Amin Shajib' is not confined to the Pipilika scandal alone. Similar tales of mischief have surfaced, strikingly reminiscent of what happened with Pipilika. Although a written complaint with evidence was filed with the SUST CSE department, no resolution was found in almost two years, reflecting a lack of goodwill from the concerned parties.

Recently, more revelations about 'Ruhul Amin Shajib's' misdeeds have come to the inventors' attention. Having endured years of deprivation, they understand the devastating impact such incidents can have on an individual's well-being. Thus, on June 18, 2023, Pipilika's dark history of intellectual property theft was made public through a series of posts on Facebook.

The aim of this effort is to compile the episodes and evidence published on Facebook. If sharing our story can prevent even one student from falling victim to academic malpractice in the future, we will consider this endeavor a success.
