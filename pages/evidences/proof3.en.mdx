# IP theft of First-ever Bengla search engine 'Pipilika': Unmasking Dr. Ruhul Amin Shajib - Proof 3

Pipilika was Burhan and Chisty's pet project from the beginning. Below is a screenshot showing a January 2009 email to the CSE Society Yahoo Group asking for information on building a search engine, indicating that they were already working on the project. Using the name and logo of their personal project for years without their permission and attempting to claim their contribution as part of just another project's heritage is nothing but a burglary. I am providing a copy of the email conversation as supporting evidence.

The image shows a fully functional first version of Pipilika using an Oracle database that was fully developed and released before Ruhul Amin even joined the university. The source code of this version is still available to us.
