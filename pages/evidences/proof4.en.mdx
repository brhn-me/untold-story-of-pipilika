## Dropping One from a Team of Two?!!

Next came the National Collegiate Software Contest (NCSC) held on 29th September 2011. Although we had already joined jobs, our contributions to the project continued. During that time, some final year university students joined our work, but the main and substantial contribution remained ours alone. Shockingly, without informing us, the project was showcased in the contest by some junior brothers. The participant list is available in the email.

Below is the members' list of Team Pipilika inside the attached Excel file. It should be noted that Ruhul Amin Sajib intentionally removed one of the two inventors, Burhan Uddin, from the two-person team, leading to discontent among us. In response, Burhan emailed some alumni of the university, explaining the details and providing evidence of intentional infliction of emotional pain, frustration, and humiliation caused by the artful activities of Dr. Ruhul Amin Shajib, who played a "divide and conquer" game.
