# IP theft of First-ever Bengla search engine 'Pipilika': Unmasking Dr. Ruhul Amin Shajib - Proof 2

If you read this evidence, you will understand how he attempted a terrible academic malpractice to place his name first in the paper. In retaliation to our disagreement with his mischievous proposal, he plotted a roadmap to remove us from our own project. However, his endeavors to claim credit for our hard work persisted for a decade.

This evidence is crucial as it proves that his verbal claim to become the first author was not written anywhere, contrary to what he thought. In 2021, we lacked this evidence during the clash.

Seizing an opportunity, his cohorts attacked and harassed us in a private social media group asking for proof, but we ultimately found undeniable proof of his attempt to shift from supervisory last author to first author through an email from a decade ago.

## Karma, perhaps? 
He outright denied ever claiming first authorship of our paper during the 2021 clash, leaving us frustrated in our attempt to prove our tea stall discussion. However, strangely, a few months later, I (Burhan) searched all emails with Shajib again and discovered an email from about 10 years ago, containing perfect evidence of his efforts to forcefully place his name first. It seems the Creator left something for his karma after all.

In the email, it can be seen that Burhan had drafted an abstract of a paper and sent it to him. He had then made changes to the draft and sent it back with his name listed first, followed by Chisty's name, and finally, Burhan's name at last.

Naturally, Burhan wanted an explanation for this ordering, but 'Teacher' Shajib did not provide any reply. Burhan expressed his feelings of being insulted without receiving a response. However, later on, this teacher completely denied the matter of placing names first to all members in the CSE society group in 2021. It seems evident that this 'teacher' brother attempted to conceal the truth in this situation.

## Outright Lies and Denials via Social Media

In 2021, when this topic began to be debated in an internal group, and he was asked for clarification regarding why he wanted to be the first author, he outright lied, stating that he had never attempted to be the first author in his life. He believed that we would never be able to provide any proof of what was said in the tea stall verbally. However, he unknowingly left the evidence in an email from a decade ago. Perhaps this is what is called Karma!!
