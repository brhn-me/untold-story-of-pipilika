# IP theft of First-ever Bengla search engine 'Pipilika': Unmasking Dr. Ruhul Amin Shajib - Proof 1

## Demonstration of Pipilika Bangla Search Engine

Here is a short video shot in March 2011. Here is a demonstration video of Pipilika Bengali search engine under our (Chisty's and Burhan's) CodersNuke banner. Full functional Pipilika Search Engine's functionality, user manual, and even the contact page are shown here; Where Ahmed Chisty, Burhan Uddin, and Ruhul Amin Shajib are named clearly in team details. (Watch from 11 minutes 50 seconds)

Ironically, the teacher Ruhul Amin Sajib, who came to take credit for this work, himself established our contribution in the first Bangla search engine 'Pipilika' and gave a voice over here. Ironyâ€¦  Watch with video

**Voice Over Credits: Dr. Ruhul Amin Shajib**
