# IP theft of First-ever Bengla search engine 'Pipilika': Unmasking Dr. Ruhul Amin Shajib - Part 1

![Pipilika Theif](/static/images/pipilika-theif.png#centered)

We are revealing a distressing tale of intellectual theft that has haunted us for twelve long years – the pioneering Bengali search engine, "Pipilika." Dr. Ruhul Amin Shajib, a former 'lecturer' at Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST), stands accused of shamelessly engaging in credit theft, stealing the recognition and fame that rightfully belong to the true contributors, Burhan Uddin and Ahmed Chisty. Today, we break our silence and expose this dark chapter that has been concealed from the public for far too long.

In 2021, we attempted to bring this matter to light through the Computer Science and Engineering Department. To our dismay, the faculty showed little intent in addressing the issue, leaving us with doubts about their true motivations. Consequently, we have taken it upon ourselves to expose this grave academic malpractice to the public.

Our intention is not to defame anyone but to shed light on this national-level incident of academic misconduct, causing us immense suffering for a decade. Pipilika, the first Bengali search engine, has been widely acclaimed, but this incident stands as one of the most significant copyright infrigment cases in Bangladesh's history.

Witnessing the same individual perpetrate such deceitful actions repeatedly, even in recent times, is both disheartening and infuriating. The plight of hardworking individuals denied the recognition they deserve for their efforts is truly distressing.

This article serves as a poignant warning for students in Bangladesh, especially those passionate about research. Awareness is the first step in combating this national-level "fraudulent thesis supervisor".

Failing to be vigilant might result in one's hard work going unrecognized, while others thrive on ill-gotten gains. Those dedicated to research understand the hardships and devastating impact of having their efforts overlooked.

## A pattern of intellectual fraud
His intellectual fraudulent activities started innocently but have been recurring over the past decade, as we heard numerous incidents of credit theft in various projects. A common trend emerged in these projects: he seeks out talented individuals skilled in studies, work, and programming, showering them with encouragement. Many SUSTians, drawn by his prestigious reputation and high GPA, eagerly collaborate with him on research endeavors. However, the outcome is dishearteningly predictable – a remarkable project, dataset, or paper materializes, but those who actually contributed significantly are left out, their hard work and dedication overlooked. He effortlessly assumes the lead position, ignoring others' opinions, and positions himself as the first author of scientific papers.

As mature individuals, we eventually realized the injustice done to us by the "teacher" occupying a position of respect. However, the realization leaves us grappling with a tough choice. Speaking up could lead to undesirable consequences such as dropping courses or jeopardizing future opportunities for higher education, where a recommendation from the thesis supervisor holds significant weight. Breaking free from this control is no easy feat, so we remain silent, suppressing our grievances.

## Speaking up for the first time
In 2013, we made the unfortunate mistake of keeping quiet. However, the gravity of the situation became apparent as we observed Dr. Ruhul Amin Sajib repeating the same deceptive actions with other juniors, both within and outside SUST. He shamelessly capitalizes on others' hard work, only to abandon the project or claim the prestigious positions for himself, while no one dares to raise objections.

When we finally decided to speak up in 2021, he responded with vulgar abuse in the SUST Alumni Group, dismissing our claims as baseless and attempting to win sympathy by portraying himself as a victim of insult and harassment. These tactics, we later discovered, were deployed against others as well. Rather than refuting the evidence, he manipulates the narrative and unleashes attacks from his cohorts to divert attention from the core issue.


## Ruhul Amin Sajib's deceitful misdeeds in a nutshell
1. He cunningly exhibited our Bengali search engine project, Pipilika, at a science fair without our knowledge or presence, and deceitfully claimed the first prize for himself. To add insult to injury, he falsely presented the first prize medal to Zafar Iqbal, erasing our hard work from the spotlight.

2. As Pipilika gained momentum, he ruthlessly silenced us from discussing journalists. He even resorted to abusing Burhan when Kaler Kantha - A Bangla Newspaper reached him out for an interview. 

3. Adding to his list of misconduct, he subjected Burhan to mistreatment for simultaneously working on the "Paperless Admission" project under Abu Shoeb's guidance, alongside Pipilika.

4. Without any regard for the truth, he maliciously spread rumors within the department, falsely painting us as money-hungry individuals when refused to join Pipilika due to disputes over the leadership of someone we couldn't align with. It was a blatant attempt to tarnish our reputation and undermine the credibility of our genuine concerns.


5. Shamelessly, he forced himself to be the first author of the research paper on Pipilika, despite merely playing a supervisory role. When we stood up against this injustice, he displayed his displeasure and refused to cooperate in the paper's writing.


6. As we embarked on writing the paper and crafted the abstract, we were taken aback when he audaciously inserted his name as the lead authorship for himself, forcefully putting it in the paper and raising doubts about his true motives. When confronted about this questionable move, he evaded any explanation and, rather unjustly, shifted the blame onto the main researchers, Chisty and Burhan, for the delay in progress. His actions left us feeling frustrated and disheartened, as he seemed determined to snatch credit and control away from the very individuals who had poured their hearts into the project.


7. Taking advantage of financial investments in the project, he callously stripped away everything from the two genuine contributors, Burhan and Chisty, including the source code, logo design, and data collected from the internet, without involving them in any capacity.


8. At the much-anticipated launch of 'Pipilika,' he deliberately omitted any recognition for Burhan and Chisty, despite their presence at the event. Instead, he publicly insulted them, reducing their contributions to mere logo design and naming of the project.


9. He went as far as threatening us with a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), using it as leverage and claiming that it was standard practice across all departments. Such agreements are typically employed in employment settings, not undergraduate theses at our university.


10. He used indirect intimidation tactics, exploiting the fact that Burhan and Chisty had dropped some courses to subdue and control them.


11. Sajib's aggressive reaction to those who stood up for Burhan and Chisty, denying them the rightful recognition they deserved, further exemplifies his deceitful nature that has persisted over the years.

12. Despite claiming that the project belonged to the department in point 9, in 2020, he shockingly sent emails to the CSE department, asserting himself as the principal inventor, and demanding ownership.

13. When Burhan Chisty sought an explanation in an alumni group on social media, Sajib's response was nothing short of abusive and defensive. 

14. Attempting to portray himself as a victim, he employed the tactic of playing the harassment card, trying to garner sympathy.

15. He went to great lengths to manipulate people, persuading them to write against Burhan and Chisty on social media platforms, a desperate attempt to undermine the truth.



In the above points, the glaring conspiracy unfolds before your eyes, exposing the calculated maneuvers of 'Teacher' Ruhul Amin Shajib as he shamelessly swiped all the credits of the project, leaving the two true contributors in the shadows. As the tale progresses, it becomes evident that this was just the beginning of his treacherous ambitions. With a cunning roadmap in hand, he set his sights on claiming ownership of projects worth a million dollars, right from their inception.
The intricate process of building search engines, the intricate history behind it, and the relentless pursuit of possession by Ruhul Amin await you in the next post.
