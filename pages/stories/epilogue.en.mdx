# Epilogue

Our story has evolved into something greater than a mere account of personal experiences. It now stands as a symbol of courage and a call to action against academic malpractices not only within Bangladesh but throughout academia worldwide. We hope that our journey will inspire others to raise their voices earlier, preventing them from enduring the same mistakes and needless suffering we faced for years.

The global prevalence of such practices serves as a stark reminder of the importance of our story. It stands as a cautionary tale for newcomers, shedding light on how dedication can be exploited by credit thieves seeking fame and recognition without putting in the hard work. Those who place trust in thesis or project partners, or even in revered teachers, may unknowingly fall victim to deceitful facades.

With an unwavering determination, we emphasize that our intentions are free from animosity towards anyone. We do not seek to defame individuals or institutions, including SUST CSE. Our mission is solely driven by the pursuit of truth, and we are committed to exposing it through every available means. Our primary goal is to protect and guide future generations, ensuring that juniors navigate their academic journeys cautiously, shielded from unnecessary suffering.

It is crucial to recognize that one individual, Ruhul Amin, does not represent the integrity and ethics of all the teachers at SUST CSE. Our story is a specific reflection of our own experience, and we sincerely hope that sharing it will contribute to a more transparent and respectful academic environment for all. Let our tale resonate as a beacon of awareness, inspiring positive change and nurturing a more ethical educational atmosphere. Together, we can forge a future where every student can thrive, free from the shadows of deceit and manipulation.

As we conclude our story, let it stand as a testament to the power of truth and the courage to expose injustice. To all those who have read and followed our journey, we extend our heartfelt gratitude. Your support and attention have been invaluable, empowering our resolve to seek justice and bring our truth to light.

Before we part ways, we must acknowledge and express our deepest gratitude to all who have supported us in bringing this truth to the public, standing courageously on the side of ethics. Your unwavering belief in our cause has been a driving force behind our determination to seek justice and shed light on deceitful practices. Each and every one of you, regardless of how big or small your contribution, has played a crucial role in our journey. Your encouragement has uplifted us in challenging times, and your solidarity has given us the strength to persevere.
